Due to the number of reviews, and how long it takes to pre-process 
all of them when only a handful are being used. I split it in 
sentiment_analysis_part_1 and sentiment_analysis_part_2. Part_1 
does the pre-processing then shores the data. This free part_2 
up for rapid sentiment analysis.

The sentiment_analysis_alternative was made outside the specs, 
so I could use it to help me with the report, as it able to do 
rapid sentiment analysis while be able to access the original data.
